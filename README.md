ðŸ¦¦ Hello my name is Oscar Ochoa, and I am currently a computer science student at California State University Monterey Bay.

ðŸŽ¸ When I am not on my computer I enjoy the processes of learning new things! My hobbies tend to change very often because of my obsession to learn. Currently I           am learning how to play guitar.

ðŸ›¹ Just before I got into playing guitar, my obession was skating. I never learned as a kid, so I just have it a shot. I went in with the assumption I had good           balance, but skating was a very humbling and painful experience. By far the hardest hobby I have yet to master.
