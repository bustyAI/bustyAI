# ðŸ‘‹ Hey, Iâ€™m @bustyAI
## ![Octocat](https://github.com/bustyAI/bustyAI/blob/main/assets/octo.png) About me

ðŸ¦¦ Hello my name is Oscar Ochoa, and I am currently a computer science student at California State University Monterey Bay.

:bamboo: I graduated from Coding Dojo in May with my Data Science Certificate.

ðŸŽ¸ When I am not on my computer I enjoy the processes of learning new things! My hobbies tend to change very often because of my obsession to learn. Currently I           am learning how to play guitar.

ðŸ›¹ Just before I got into playing guitar, my obession was skating. I never learned as a kid, so I just gave it a shot. I went in with the assumption I had good           balance, but skating was a very humbling and painful experience. By far the hardest hobby I have yet to master.

:computer: Coming from a small farming city in the central valley (Delano), I hadn't had much exposure to STEM related topics. This is why in the future I hope to
           teach computer science at low income schools. To be able to give those students an opportunity to maybe fall in love with the subject as I did.
      
## Projects
- Movie project: Gathered data from tmdb and imdb in order to analyze what makes a great movie. Is it budget, revenue, or MPAA rating? [:movie_camera:](https://github.com/bustyAI/Movie-Project) **<-- click me and find out**

- Cat Classifier: I have 5 Cats, so I decided to build a muliticlass classification model that will predict each of my cats by name! (in pytorch btw)
