🦦   Hi, I'm Oscar Ochoa. I'm currently studying Computer Science at Cal State Monterey Bay set to graduate August 2024.

🎸   I consider myself a lifelong learner. My passion for learning extends beyond Computer Science, and my interests often evolve. Currently, my new hobby is learning to play the guitar. Before I got into learning the guitar, my obession was skating. Not having any expereince on the skateboard. I hadn't realized how challenging it would be just to balance. This experience has taught me that many things that seem simple can actually be difficult.

:computer:   Coming from Delano, a small farming town in the Central Valley, I had limited exposure to STEM topics. This why I hope to teach Computer Science at low-income schools. I want to offer students the chance to explore opportunities beyond agriculture and farming, allowing them to develop their own interests rather than feeling confined to what's familiar.

🖱️ I enjoy creating software, from the complex backend to the elegant frontend. Anything that involves telling a computer what to do i'm in. I am always open to collaborating on new projects to further develop my skill set. Feel free to reach out to collaborate.
